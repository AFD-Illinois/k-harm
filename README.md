K/HARM: Implementing HARM in C++ with Kokkos

This project is in early stages of a large refactor from C to C++/Kokkos!
Thus it is *not* guaranteed to be operable as work progresses!  See
[iharm3D](https://github.com/AFD-Illinois/iharm3d) for a more stable version
of the same algorithm.

# Building
K/HARM is built with CMake.  This can be done manually, or by looking through
and editing the file `make.sh`, which has a sample set of flags for different
compilation modes and architectures.
